### [Lyve Minds, Inc](http://lyveminds.com) • OS X Engineer • _2013-Present_
I work on the Macintosh client application for our photo/video storage appliance. Areas of particular focus are application frameworks, view system management, and design prototyping in conjunction with our UX team. This application will be released in the spring of 2014.

### [Medium](http://medium.com) • iOS Engineer • _2012-2013_
I developed several exploratory iOS applications for The Obvious Corporation’s medium.com product. The focus of my work was frameworks for data persistence, network interactions, and markup parsing and presentation. My work made extensive use of multiple iOS text processing and rendering technologies.

### [Voxer](http://voxer.com) • Technical Lead, Client Engineering • _2010-2012_
I designed and implemented the framework upon which the Voxer Walkie-Talkie iPhone application was built.  Voxer was consistently a top-100 title in the iOS App Store and has tens of millions of users. I contributed to all aspects of our technology solutions from the underlying network protocols up through the UI/UX. I managed the engineering team working on our iOS products, worked with the head of product development to define the roadmap, and worked with the head of our QA department to define acceptance criteria.

Prior to the technical lead position I worked on a variety of other aspects of the company’s technology. This included our push notification system, audio interfaces, principal engineering on miscellaneous server components, and whatever else needed help.

### [Google](http://www.google.com/mobile/android/) • Senior Software Engineer - Android • _2005-2009_
I worked on all aspects of Android software development at Google: UI design, rapid prototyping, tools for the Dalvik VM team, application frameworks, and many of the flagship applications, including (among others) GMail, Google Talk, Calendar, and the web browser.

As a generalist, I was itinerant among various Android groups which were having difficulty making progress, where my job was to assess the situation and figure out how to fix it. This included design, principal engineering, optimization, debugging, as well as project restructuring to adhere to best practices.

I co-designed the window-shade notification system and the keyboard layout.

### Danger • Senior Software Engineer  • _2000-2005_
Danger developed the hardware and backend service for the hiptop, the [original smart phone](https://medium.com/tech-talk/d823af31f7c), and the first to store all of its data in the cloud. It also pioneered other technologies such as over-the-air OS updates, push notifications, an on-device app store, always-on data networking, and many other features that are core to modern smartphones. I designed and implemented a significant part of the original software including the majority of the application framework, view system, graphics toolkit, all of the UI widgets, the text editing engine, the internationalization system, and many of the network wire protocols for synchronizing data between the device and the backend service.

I wrote the email client, much of the IM client, some of the address book, and a complete LiveJournal client that was issued as developer sample code.

For the Sidekick2 model I did the initial bring-up work for Bluetooth support. I evaluated various protocol stacks, integrated the chosen stack with our OS, designed and implemented the native/Java bridge software layers, and designed and implemented the Java-based UI for configuration and management of Bluetooth settings.

### [Apple](http://www.apple.com) • Senior Software Engineer - Game Technology Group • _1996-2000_
I was an engineer on DrawSprocket, a toolkit to manage screen configuration and accelerate 2D blitting. I wrote much of the documentation for all of the Sprockets, and wrote and presented our sessions at WWDC. I did outreach to other groups at Apple whenever there was a chance to improve their technologies in the interest of better game support, and worked with numerous 3rd parties to help them adopt Sprockets technologies.

### Interplay/MacPlay • Software Engineer  • _1992-1996_
I was one of two full-time engineers working on the Mac games developed by Interplay's MacPlay division. I shipped 15 titles in my four years there. Notable titles were: Out of this World, Star Trek: Judgment Rites (programming and writing credits), SimCity CD-ROM, and Beat the House.  I spent a significant portion of my time developing libraries that were used in all of our games, and shared with our affiliate developers, to simplify tasks such as screen resolution switching, palette management, video gamma adjustment, keyboard input, CD-ROM access, etc.
